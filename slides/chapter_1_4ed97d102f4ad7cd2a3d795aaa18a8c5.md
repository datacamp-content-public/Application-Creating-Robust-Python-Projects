## Introduction to Python Project Principles

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "867f3e4a7b"
```

`@part1`
Goal: Establish principles to follow for all projects.

The modularity principle is especially important.

Modularity makes code easier to 
- organize, 
- maintain, 
- debug,
- test, and
- reuse.

Project come in all shapes and sizes.

Project deliverables may be
- a document describing an analysis,
- a web app that enables exploration of a dataset,
- a program that allows runs

## The Opposite of Modular

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d00704249b"
```

`@part1`
The opposite of modular is monolithic.

An example of a monolithic file is a Jupyter Notebook that has all of the
- code,
- documentation, and
- output.

Monolithic files can be convenient, but are a bad starting point.

Instead, write scripts to `%load` and `%run` in your notebooks.

You can use notebooks without sacrificing modularity!

## What are modules?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d28e7b40dc"
```

`@part1`
Modules are

- plain-text files that
- have a `.py` extension and
- contain Python code. 

Modules allow code resusability
- Variables,
- Functions, and
- Classes

## Modules versus scripts

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ab730708e1"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
Modules are similar to scripts in that both

- are plain-text files that
- have a `.py` extension and
- contain Python code.

The distinction is that modules should define
- Variables,
- Functions, and/or
- Classes.

The Python programming language has a [Batteries Included Philosophy](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy). This means that
