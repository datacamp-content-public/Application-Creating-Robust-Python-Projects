## The Modularity Principle

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "867f3e4a7b"
```

`@part1`
Lesson Goal: Establish principles to follow for all projects.

The modularity principle is especially important.

Modularity makes code easier to 
- organize, 
- maintain, 
- debug,
- test, and
- reuse.

Project come in all shapes and sizes.

Project deliverables may be
- a document describing an analysis,
- a web app that enables exploration of a dataset,
- a program that allows runs

## Modular versus Monolithic

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d00704249b"
```

`@part1`
The opposite of modular is monolithic.

A monolithic file could contain all project
- code,
- documentation, and
- output.

To get the best of both worlds,
1. write modular Python code files and then
2. combine into monolithic files.


`@script`
Monolithic files can be convenient, but are a bad starting point.

## Scripts versus Modules

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ffe2e848d0"
```

`@part1`
Scripts and modules 
- are plain-text files that
- have `.py` extensions and
- contain Python code.

The key difference is how you use them.

| Action | Filetype | Goal                            |
|--------|----------|---------------------------------|
| Run    | Script   | Do things, e.g. make a plot     |
| Import | Module   | Define classes and/or functions |

It is possible for the same file to be used as both a module and a script.
